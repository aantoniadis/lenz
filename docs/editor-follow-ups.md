# Editor follow-ups

Record findings here instead of expanding the current editor implementation. Deal
with these after the approved work is done. A finding that blocks an approved
ticket's acceptance remains in that ticket; this file does not waive its checks.

## Deferred observations

- **TUI overhead:** the final snapshot-window comparison measured startup RSS
  +0.592 MiB and completed Go To median +0.085 ms, with substantial timing
  variation. Settled RSS decreased. The user accepted the documented batch costs
  on 2026-10-24; retain this as a later optimization opportunity.
  Evidence: `docs/research/reader-snapshot-tui-performance.md` on the TUI branch
  and `target/perf/editor-implementation/09/native-final-summary.json`.
- **Find before results arrive:** `Session::find_step` currently returns without
  navigating while the match list is empty. Check whether Enter pressed during
  the initial asynchronous search should be remembered and applied when results
  arrive. This was found while preparing the native reveal regression.
- **Find query selection:** inspect Ctrl+A while the GUI Find field is focused.
  `ReaderView::find_key` currently lets this shortcut fall through to the parent
  handler. Verify the intended behavior before changing it; this is an observed
  routing question, not yet a demonstrated defect.
- **Additional native shaping coverage:** extend owned-display checks to more
  fonts and Arabic/Indic shaping at projection boundaries. The current native
  diagnostic covers six bounded samples; TestPlatform metrics differ from the
  native backend. Do not claim the broader coverage already exists.
- **Pathological first-content measurement:** measure native first feedback and
  completed layout separately for very long combining-mark runs. The retained
  window leak has a regression check; equivalent native startup measurements for
  that specific input remain a follow-up.
- **Pinned benchmark helper selection:** fake-provider fixture setup currently
  invokes Cargo before locating its helper beside the test executable. A future
  explicit prebuilt-helper option would make immutable benchmark archives easier
  to replay and prevent accidental compilation inside quiet runs. The current
  measurements retain the expected directory layout and use `CARGO=/usr/bin/true`.
- **Presentation work during native reveal:** review whether automatically issued
  commands such as `ColourResults` should supersede a pending native reveal. The
  cancellation classifier currently exempts a small set of adapter feedback
  commands. Reproduce semantic-result navigation with fresh result coloring before
  treating this as a defect; do not start a separate investigation now.
- **Unwrapped shift-arrow column policy:** ordinary Up/Down again preserves shared
  display columns across Unicode, expanded tabs and hints. The pre-existing
  unwrapped `Extend` path retains source-byte columns. Evaluate that separate
  selection policy before making shift-arrow behavior match ordinary navigation;
  it was not changed by the integration gate repair.
- **Local gate build concurrency:** the combined 08–10 gate launched many
  simultaneous linkers and showed substantial host I/O pressure while building
  workspace test binaries. Compare a bounded Cargo job count on a later cold
  build before changing the gate; this is an operational observation, not a
  demonstrated product regression. Evidence: the batch gate log under
  `target/perf/editor-implementation/merge-08-10/`.
- **Draft-aware blame presentation:** saved-file blame currently uses the reader's
  current line index. Before production typing is enabled, cover inserting and
  deleting lines in an annotated draft and undoing them; hide or map annotations
  that no longer describe the current line. The ticket-12 input gate remains off
  in production, and its focused traces do not claim draft-aware blame support.
- **Typing-group allocation:** compact history currently joins inserted/deleted
  group text when adjacent edits coalesce. This copies the group's changed text,
  not the document. Use the scheduled batch measurements before deciding whether
  mutable group-string capacity is worthwhile; no extra benchmark run is needed
  per ticket.

- **Many-tab dirty indicator cost:** `State::tab_dirty(TabId)` currently locates
  the tab by scanning the tab collection. Header painting now queries dirty state
  for each tab; include many-tab counts in the planned batch measurements before
  deciding whether to expose a borrowed-tab or iterator form. The draft dirty
  comparison itself is constant time; no text is copied by this lookup.
